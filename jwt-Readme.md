This code snippet sets up JWT authentication using Passport.js. Here are the comments explaining each part:

const passport = require("passport"); - Import the Passport module.

const JWTStrategy = require("passport-jwt").Strategy; - Import the JWT strategy for Passport.

const ExtractJWT = require("passport-jwt").ExtractJwt; - Import the utility for extracting the JWT from the request.

const Doctor = require("../model/doctor"); - Import the Doctor model from the specified path.

let opts = { jwtFromRequest: ExtractJWT.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken, secretOrKey: "secret" }; - Set up options for the JWT authentication strategy. It specifies that the JWT will be extracted from the Authorization header using the Bearer token scheme and uses the "secret" string as the secret key to verify the JWT's signature.

passport.use(new JwtStrategy(opts, function (jwt_payload, done) { ... }) - Configure the JWT authentication strategy for Passport. It takes in the options and a callback function.

Doctor.findById(jwt_payload.\_id, (err, user) => { ... }) - Find the doctor in the database using the doctor's ID extracted from the JWT payload.

if (user) { return done(null, user); } else { return done(null, false); } - If the doctor is found, pass the user object to the next middleware. Otherwise, authentication fails.

module.exports = passport; - Export the configured passport module for use in other parts of the application.

This code snippet is for creating a session or signing in a doctor. Here's the breakdown of the comments:

// Find the doctor with the provided email - Attempts to find the doctor in the database based on the provided email from the request body.

// Check if the doctor exists and verify the password - Verifies if a doctor with the provided email exists and compares the password with the one provided in the request body. If either condition fails, an error response is sent indicating invalid username/password.

// Generate a JWT token for the authenticated doctor - If the doctor exists and the password is correct, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated using the jwt.sign function, with the doctor's data as the payload and the "hospital" string as the secret key. The token is set to expire after 10000 seconds (approximately 2.8 hours).

// Return a successful response with the generated token - If the authentication is successful, a response with a status of 200 is sent, along with a success message and the generated token.

// Return an error response for any caught exceptions - If any error occurs during the process, a 500 Internal Server Error response is sent, along with the error message for debugging purposes.
